# company-test
My understanding of how good company is.  
Remember, interview is a date. It's not only company is checking you - it's also you're checking potential company.  
Bluntly lying on interview is a good way to get somewhere you don't like nor belong.  
Companies are mostly aiming for someone who'd do a decent job... for approved amount of money.  
Not many companies are looking for truly passionate engineers nor superstars. To know what you're getting yourself into
it's best to ask questions that provide more information than company is going to willingly share by themselves.

Here is a list of questions that must help you understand company issues before you get the role.  

## Questions

Each one presumes solid answer. Avoiding direct answer shall be treated as  
"nothing we're proud of, and we don't talk about it".  
You have to be skilled enough to understand the answers too. Do your own research on terminology provided after the question.  
I'll likely elaborate more in future updates, yet for now it's a short list for my own usage.

1. What’s the process of implementing entirely new feature? Jira/Confluence/ADR
2. Do estimates work in the team? How often tasks move from one iteration to next one? 
3. Is there a bug policy in the company? How do you treat exceptions and warnings appearing on production? 
4. Do you use quality control tools? phpunit/phpstan/phpcs/deptrac/etc.? In every project? What’s the strictness/volume used there? 
5. Do you have CI/CD? How long does it take to run merge-request pipelines? To perform production deployment? 
6. Do you overtime? How often? 
7. Do you perform engineering duties? Why? When did you start doing that? 
8. Do you perform sort of knowledge sharing? Workshops/Meetups/Blogs
9. Do you have R&D department of any sort? How does it operate?
